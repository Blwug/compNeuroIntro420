For this exercise you will need a sheet of graph paper and a *rule*.

Think of this /rule/ as a mathematical function. You are going to consider a particular grid cell. You will put into your rule the list of the three cells above-left, above, and above-right and whether they are painted black or white. From that input your /rule/ will specify an output of either "black" or "white". You color the square or not accordingly.

#+CAPTION: Automata has a 1D grid with Neighbors. You are cell number "2". You decide whether to stay the same color or switch based on your value and the neighbor to your left or right. For visualization purposes time runs down. You color each square in the next row of the graph paper based on its value update in the row above.
#+NAME:   fig:grid.png

You should think of this /rule/ as a computer function as well.

#+Name: Rule Demonstration
#+Caption: A simple rule: nothing changes
#+begin_src lisp :results silent :tangle ./test-tangle.lisp :exports code
(defun rule0 (ns) 
	   (match ns
	     ('('w 'w 'w) 'w)
	     ('('w 'w 'b) 'w)
	     ('('w 'b 'w) 'w)
	     ('('b 'w 'w) 'w)
	     ('('w 'b 'b) 'w)
	     ('('b 'w 'b) 'w)
	     ('('b 'b 'w) 'w)
	     ('('b 'b 'b) 'w)))
  #+end_src

We have three cells to consider, and they can each be one of two values. That means there are $2\times2\times2$ or $8$ cases our rule has to cover. For each of those 8 cases the output can be either of two values so we have $2^8$ possible rules (though you might think that we only have half that many since all white or all black is pretty much the same thing).

Each rule is considered as a binary number. For example rule 0 is "00000000" because that is the binary representation of 0, whereas "00011110" is what number? [fn:1]

You can create a rule by adapting my code to change the 'w' â†’ 'b' wherever your binary number would have a 'b'. So to make rule 110 we would change the function to:

#+Name: rule:110
#+Caption: Rule 110 for "01101110"
#+begin_src lisp :results silent :tangle ./test-tangle.lisp :exports code
(defun rule110 (ns) 
	   (match ns
	     ('('w 'w 'w) 'w)
	     ('('w 'w 'b) 'b)
	     ('('w 'b 'w) 'b)
	     ('('b 'w 'w) 'w)
	     ('('w 'b 'b) 'b)
	     ('('b 'w 'b) 'b)
	     ('('b 'b 'w) 'b)
	     ('('b 'b 'b) 'w)))
  #+end_src


** The activity :class_exercise:

1. We need to have something to start with. Put a black square in the center middle of your graph paper. [fn:2] You need to do this, because I will call on a random subset of you to exhibit your pattern. 
2. Send in the chat the number for the rule you are going to follow. You can pick any rule you want except for 0 or 110, or the number that anyone before you has already selected.
3. Follow your rule and work across and down coloring each row based on the update of the cell above it.
4. Do enough rows to get a sense of the pattern, and then message in the chat that you are done.
5. *Save your image*. If it is a piece of paper take a picture of it. If it is a spreadsheet take a screen grab. You will have to submit that to the dropbox on learn for credit for today's activity.
6. A *homework* for this activity will be to reproduce your rule as a bit of computer code. You will use any programming language (other than lisp) to write a function like the one I have written for outputting the color of a square based on the input of its neighbors.

#+Name: code:make-rule
#+Caption: Automate where you can. This is my first (successful) attempt to generate a function that will write its own function to map the outputs based on the number of the rule. It basically writes a function like the ones we have above. It substitutes the output for the color that goes with the number of the rule. It should be possible to make the matching part more concise and not require me to manually call each element, but the perfect can be the enemy of the good. Often times it is better to get something that works up and running. If you need to later on you can make it more efficient or elgant. 
#+begin_src lisp :results silent :tangle ./test-tangle.lisp :exports code
  (defun make-rule (rule-no)
      (flet ((white-or-black? (in-char)

	   ('('w 'w 'b) (white-or-black? (elt test-char 1)))
	   ('('w 'b 'w) (white-or-black? (elt test-char 2)))
	   ('('b 'w 'w) (white-or-black? (elt test-char 3)))
	   ('('w 'b 'b) (white-or-black? (elt test-char 4)))
	   ('('b 'w 'b) (white-or-black? (elt test-char 5)))
	   ('('b 'b 'w) (white-or-black? (elt test-char 6)))
	   ('('b 'b 'b) (white-or-black? (elt test-char 7))))))))

Cellular automata provide some basic lessons that lay the ground work for thinking about neural networks.

You can think of each cell in the grid as a neuron. It receives input via it's dendrites and it has a current state (e.g. the internal voltage). Based on its current voltage and the input to the neuron it does or does not fire. With our automata the cell's current color was its voltage and the color of the neighbors on either side were the inputs to our grid cell's dendrites.

*** You can think of cells (or units or neurons) as functions or computations

*** Automata are themselves viewed as a model of the brain

Two definitions of a vector:

1) It is an object (arrow) with magnitude and direction
2) It is a (by convention) column of numbers

For different purposes one or the other definition may prove more convenient.

A matrix can be considered as a collection of vectors or, in our case, as a rectangular (2-D) collection of numbers.

**** Activity
Using your preferred programming language figure out how to construct an array/matrix.

Make two of them and make them the same size (what is the /size/ of a matrix?).

Add them together in both orders (A + B and B + A)

Then do the same for multiplication. Note that there are particular requirements for the sizes of matrices in order from the to be able to be multiplied one versus another and very strict requirements for being able to be multiplied in both directions.

What is the name for the operation when A*B = B*A?

To get you started [[https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/routines.array-creation.html][here]] are many different ways to create array in python and [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_matrices.htm][R]].

*** Common Notational Conventions for Vectors and Matrices
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: notation
   :END:

Vectors tend to be notated as /lower case/ letters, often in bold, such
as $\mathbf{a}$. They are also occasionally represented with little
arrows on top such as $\overrightarrow{\textbf{a}}$.

Matrices tend to be notated as /upper case/ letters, typically in bold,
such as $\mathbf{M}$.

Good things to know: what is an /inner product/? How do you compute it in your preferred programming language?

*** Another Homework

Submit a simple program that accepts two matrices, checks if they are of compatible sizes, and then computes their inner product. 


* What is a Neural Network?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: what-is-a-neural-network
  :END:

What is a Neural Network? It is a brain inspired computational approach
in which "neurons" compute functions of their inputs and pass on a
/weighted/ proportion to the next neuron in the chain.

#+CAPTION: Simple schematic of the basics of a neural network. This is an image for a single neuron. The input has three elements and each of these connects to the same neuron ("Node 1"). The activity at those nodes is filtered by the weights, which are specific for each of the inputs. These three processed inputs are combined to generate the output from this neuron. For multiple layers this output becomes an input for the next neuron along the chain. 
#+NAME:   fig:grid.png

[[./nn.png]]


** Non-linearities
   The spiking of a neuron is non-linear. The increase in voltage with increasing input is not a straight line. To emulate this, and sometimes just to make the math easier, there is often further processing on the output of the neuron before it becomes the input to the next layer. In its simplest form this takes the form of a /thresholding/ operation. We did something very much like this when we set a threshold for the spike in our integrate and fire model.

#+Name: eqn:threshold-neuron
#+Caption: A simple equation to capture the thresholding of our simple one neuron with three inputs.
\begin{equation}
\mbox{if } I_1 \times w_{1,1} + I_2 \times w_{2,1} + I_3 \times w_{3,1} > \Theta \mbox{ then } Output = 1
\end{equation}

What this equation shows is that Inputs (the $I$ s) are passed to the first layer. A weighted
sum (inner product) is computed as an intermediate value. The weighted sum is fed into a threshold function that compares the value to a threshold ($\Theta$), and passes on the value 1 if it
is greater than the threshold and 0 (sometimes $-1$ is chosen) otherwise.

*** Optional Reading

This short [[https://media.nature.com/m685/nature-assets/nbt/journal/v26/n2/images/nbt1386-F1.gif][article]] provides a nice example of linear separability and some basics of what a neural network is. 

* Connections
  Can neural networks encode logic? Is the processing zeros and ones enough to capture the richness of human intellectual activity?

  In fact there is a long tradition of representing human thought as the consequence of some sort of calculation of two values (true or false). If you have two values you can swap out 1's and 0's for the true and false in your calculation. They even seem to obey similar laws. If you the conjunction (AND) of two true things it is only true when both are true. If you take T = 1, then T âˆ§ T is the same as $1~\times~1$.

  In the next section we will build up a simple threshold neural unit and try to calculate some of these truth functions with our neuron. We will build simple neurons for truth tables (like those that follow), and string them together into an argument. Then we can feed values of T and F into our network and let it calculate the XOR problem.
