We will work on this in class. Your goal is to write the code for a
spring using a differential equation to help you update your calculation
of position as a function of time. Here is a skeleton of what you will
need to get going.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  #What inputs and "magics" do you need?

  #What is the equation of a frictionless spring?

  #What is it you are plotting?

  def spring(inputs): #might need more than one input, might not
      #stuff here
      return();#something has to go in there

  def plot(inputs): #inputs just a place holder, you have to supply details
      #stuff here
      return(); #return something?

  def main():
      s = spring(1);#1's are just here to make this work without above inputs defined
      p = plot(1)
      quit = False
      if (not quit):
          q = input('Type y to quit, any other key to continue')
          if (q != 'y'):
              main()
              
  main()

Provide the code for the damped oscillator. It has the formula of

$$ \frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} = -P~s(t) - k~v(t) $$

This should really only require changing one line of your code for the
simple harmonic oscillator.
