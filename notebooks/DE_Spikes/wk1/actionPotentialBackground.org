Can you draw one? I am going to ask you to do that in a moment, and to
verify that you know ...

*** Questions:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: questions
    :END:

1. What are the axes?
2. What causes the upward deflection?
3. What is, and what causes, the overshoot?
4. Who discovered the action potential?
5. Who won the Nobel Prize for characterizing the ionic events of the
   action potential experimentally and building a mathematical model?

Psychology students should already know this, so team up with some CS
students and others to prepare your answers to the above, and then we
will work through them in a group.

Did you drawing of the action potential look like this?
