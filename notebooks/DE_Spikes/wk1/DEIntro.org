* An Introduction to Differential Equations
** Why are Differential Equations an important technique for computational modelling in psychology and neuroscience?
*** The Action Potential                                      :classExercise:
    1. 10 minutes to brush up on what an action potential is.
    2. Then be able to draw one on the board and explain,
       1. What are the axes?
       2. What ion causes the upward deflection?
       3. What causes the repolarization?
       4. Who discovered the action potential?
       5. Who won the Nobel Prize for characterizing the ionic events
          of the action potential experimentally and building a
          mathematical model?
    3. Did you draw this?

*** Why is the action potential relevant for a discussion of DE's in modelling?
    The computational model of the action potential is a partial differential equation and action potentials, "spikes", are often taken to be the information processing unit of the nervous system.

    DE's are the way we capture dynamics, how things change over time. If you think some neural or cognitive process that you are interested in is changing over time, then you are interested in dynamics and the first approach you should think of for modelling it is a differential equation.

** Notation
Concise summaries of things that would take too long to write out in detail. Mathematical notation is just a technical emoji. You probably know the "math" they represent; you just don't know the abbreviation that is being used.

Write out in long hand (or type on your computer) what is meant by the
following:

  $$\sum_{\forall x \in \left\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \right \}} x ~=~ 6$$
*** Multiple Ways to Say the Same Thing

$\frac{dy}{dx}$

$\dot{x}$

$x'$

$f'(x)$

Moral: Don't let weird symbols put you off trying to understand. Plenty of musical people can't understand a score. Just because you don't understand a mathematical score does not mean you don't understand the mathematics.

** Differential Equations: General Facts
*** What is a differential equation?
    Give me an answer that uses *no* equations. Just words. 
*** What is a derivative?
    Give me an answer that uses *no* equations. Just words. 
*** Derivatives are Slopes

**** Derivatives are Instantaneous Slopes

You pick two points that are "close enough" and you get an answer that
is "close enough." If your answer isn't "close enough" then you move
your points closer, until /in the limit/ there is an infinitesimal
distance between them.

Definition:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{(x + h) - x}$$

***** Digression: Writing Math in Documents
The current standard tool for nicely typeset math is LaTeX. You can use this in jupyter notebooks and even some in [[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/linear-format-equations-using-unicodemath-and-latex-in-word-2e00618d-b1fd-49d8-8cb4-8d17f25754f8][Word]]. However, the most powerful way is just to write the document as a simple text file with the .tex ending and use TeX post-processors. This is easiest in Linux, but isn't too hard for both Windows and OSX. Here I use LaTeX fragments in side an "org" file compiled by emacs using other programs on my computer.

**** Using Derivatives to Solve Problems With a Computer

***** What is a square root?

What is the *solution* to $y=x^2$ if I tell you what $y$ is?

Thinking about how to solve it. Some discussion questions:
1. Come up with a guess (e.g. in your head what would you guess is the
   square root of 128?).
2. Write a formula that would allow you to compute the error (or how far
   off you were).
3. How much should you adjust your guess to get closer to the correct
   answer?
4. What is the derivative of $x^2$? Does it have a place in your
   formula?
5. Give a reason graphically why you ought to be able to use this
   derivative to help improve your guess.
6. What happens to the sign of the "adjustment" when our guesses go from
   giving us too big an answer to too little an answer.

**** Pandas
     :PROPERTIES:

[[http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/][Panda's Documentation]]

There are a lot of tutorials out there, e.g.
[[https://stackabuse.com/beginners-tutorial-on-the-pandas-python-library/][Panda
for Beginners]]

By the way: you can actually run web pages inside of a Jupyter notebook

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from IPython.display import IFrame
  IFrame('http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/',width='100%',height=350)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

#+END_EXAMPLE

If you have heard of /data.frames/ in the programming language R then
you basically know what Pandas is for. It is an effort to provide the
same functionality for Python. Think of spreadsheet where you have
alabel or a name for a column of data.

**** Common Programming Constructs

3. Iterators (like for loops or while loops)

  #Constants
  guesses = [8.0]    ; #what is the difference between the 8.0 having or not having the square brackets?
  errors = [10000]  
  tolerance = 0.01
#+END_SRC

**** Finding Cube Roots
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: finding-cube-roots
     :END:

1. What is a /cube root/?

2. What is the derivative of $x^3$?

3. Find it with Python

4. Write two Python Functions: one to =return= the cube of a number, and
   one to =return= the derivative when evaluated at a particular value
   of =x=.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  x = Symbol('x')
  y = x**3
  print(diff(y,x))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  3*x**2
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here is the basic syntax for a function in Python.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  #Local Functions
  def cube (x):
      return(x**3)

  print(cube(10))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  1000
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now you write the formula for the derivative.

      return(3*x**2)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  a = [1,2,3,4]

      guesses.append(-1*errors[-1]/derivCube(guesses[-1]) + guesses[-1])

  pd.DataFrame({
      'errors' : errors,
      'guesses' :guesses
  })

** A freestanding version
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-freestanding-version
   :END:

Note bene: Sometimes to figure out what is going wrong with a function
you need to /debug/.

One simple way to do this for simple programs is to place =print=
statements at strategic points in your code so that you can see whether
the variables you are using have sensible values for test cases you can
do in your head or on paper.

For larger and more complicated programs you would write a test set that
with known inputs and outputs and you would evaluate your program on
these known cases to verify sensible behavior in an automatic fashion.
Sometimes you will see the phrase /test driven development/ to capture
this technique.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def cube (x):
      return(x**3)

  def derivCube (x):
      return(3*x**2)

  def cubeRoot(n,initGuess = 5.0):
      guess = initGuess
      error = 10000.0
      tolerance = 0.01
      i = 0
      while (abs(error) > tolerance):
          error = cube(guess) - n 
          #print(error)
          guess = -1*error/derivCube(guess) + guess
      return(guess)

  def main():
      testNum = input("Cube root of ?\n")
      print("Answer is: {0}\n".format(cubeRoot(float(testNum))))

    [[https://guicho271828.github.io/eazy-gnuplot/][Here]] is a "cookbook".

    The examples make use of a local subdirectory called "images". Create it.

    The first cookbook example seems to use a function we don't need: ~png-from-file~. This is probably related to the cookbook being a jupyter notebook.
