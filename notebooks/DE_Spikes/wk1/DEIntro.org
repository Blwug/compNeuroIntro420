* An Introduction to Differential Equations
** Why are Differential Equations an important technique for computational modelling in psychology and neuroscience?
*** The Action Potential                                      :classExercise:
    1. 10 minutes to brush up on what an action potential is.
    2. Then be able to draw one on the board and explain,
       1. What are the axes?
       2. What ion causes the upward deflection?
       3. What causes the repolarization?
       4. Who discovered the action potential?
       5. Who won the Nobel Prize for characterizing the ionic events
          of the action potential experimentally and building a
          mathematical model?
    3. Did you draw this?

*** Why is the action potential relevant for a discussion of DE's in modelling?
    The computational model of the action potential is a partial differential equation and action potentials, "spikes", are often taken to be the information processing unit of the nervous system.

    DE's are the way we capture dynamics, how things change over time. If you think some neural or cognitive process that you are interested in is changing over time, then you are interested in dynamics and the first approach you should think of for modelling it is a differential equation.

** Notation
Concise summaries of things that would take too long to write out in detail. Mathematical notation is just a technical emoji. You probably know the "math" they represent; you just don't know the abbreviation that is being used.

Write out in long hand (or type on your computer) what is meant by the
following:

  $$\sum_{\forall x \in \left\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \right \}} x ~=~ 6$$
*** Multiple Ways to Say the Same Thing

$\frac{dy}{dx}$

$\dot{x}$

$x'$

$f'(x)$

Moral: Don't let weird symbols put you off trying to understand. Plenty of musical people can't understand a score. Just because you don't understand a mathematical score does not mean you don't understand the mathematics.

** Derivatives are Instantaneous Slopes

You pick two points that are "close enough" and you get an answer that
is "close enough." If your answer isn't "close enough" then you move
your points closer, until /in the limit/ there is an infinitesimal
distance between them.

Definition:

$$\frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{(x + h) - x}$$

*** Digression: Writing Math in Documents
The current standard tool for nicely typeset math is LaTeX. You can use this in jupyter notebooks and even some in [[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/linear-format-equations-using-unicodemath-and-latex-in-word-2e00618d-b1fd-49d8-8cb4-8d17f25754f8][Word]]. However, the most powerful way is just to write the document as a simple text file with the .tex ending and use TeX post-processors. This is easiest in Linux, but isn't too hard for both Windows and OSX. Here I use LaTeX fragments in side an "org" file compiled by emacs using other programs on my computer.

**** Using Derivatives to Solve Problems With a Computer

***** What is a square root?

What is the *solution* to $y=x^2$ if I tell you what $y$ is?

Thinking about how to solve it. Some discussion questions:
1. Come up with a guess (e.g. in your head what would you guess is the
   square root of 128?).
2. Write a formula that would allow you to compute the error (or how far
   off you were).
3. How much should you adjust your guess to get closer to the correct
   answer?
4. What is the derivative of $x^2$? Does it have a place in your
   formula?
5. Give a reason graphically why you ought to be able to use this
   derivative to help improve your guess.
6. What happens to the sign of the "adjustment" when our guesses go from
   giving us too big an answer to too little an answer.

**** Working Through an Example

***** When in doubt, guess
- How much is your guess off?

 $\mbox{Error} = \mbox{(my guess)}^2 - \mbox{128}$

- How much does the error change when the guess changes?
  This is a derivative. A *rate of change*.

  $\frac{\Delta~\mbox{Error}}{\Delta~\mbox{Guess}} = \frac{\mbox{Error(Guess1) - Error(Guess0)}}{\mbox{Guess1} - \mbox{Guess0}}$

  As the guess gets very small this will approach the definition of the derivative.

We have a function for how to compute the result of our guess and we can get the derivative of that either by hand or by using a computer algebra system.

$$\frac{\mbox{dError}}{\mbox{dGuess}} = \frac{\mbox{f(Guess1)} - \mbox{goal} - \mbox{f(Guess0)} + \mbox{goal}}{\mbox{Guess1} - \mbox{Guess0}}$$

  
- Using these relations can we come up with a formula for how much we need to adjust our guess based on how big the error was?

* Practice Simulating With DEs

** Frictionless Springs

***  The equation of a frictionless spring?
$$ \frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} = -P~s(t)$$

What does it mean?

**** How do we finesse the derivatives?
Use definitions.

Imagine a little time has gone by ($\Delta~t$). What is our new position ($s$ is for space)?

$$\frac{s(t + \Delta t) - s(t)}{\Delta t} = velocity \approx \frac{d s}{d t}$$.

What is our initial velocity? Assume zero.

How will our velocity change with time?

$$\frac{v(t + \Delta t) - v(t)}{\Delta t} = acceleration \approx \frac{d v}{d t} = \frac{d^2 s}{d t^2}$$

And we have a formula for this. We can now bootstrap our simulation.

#+Name: Basic Spring Functions
#+begin_src lisp :session *de-intro-l* :results silent 
  (defun s-of-t (delta-t v s)
    (+ s (* v delta-t)))

    (+ v (* a delta-t)))
  
  (defun a-of-t (p s)
    (* -1 p s))
#+end_src

Note the similiarity of the two functions. You could write a helper function that was generic to this pattern of old value + rate of change times the  time step, and just used the pertinent values.

** Damped Oscillators

Provide the code for the damped oscillator. It has the formula of

$$ \frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} = -P~s(t) - k~v(t) $$

This should really only require changing one line of your code for the
simple harmonic oscillator.
