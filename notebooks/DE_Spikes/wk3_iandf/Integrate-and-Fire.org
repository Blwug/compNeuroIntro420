1. Read the Lapique commentary paper.
2. When did the Integrate and Fire model first become discussed?
3. What is the difference between the /leaky/ integrate and fire, the
   /forgetful/ integrate and fire, and the /plain/ integrate and fire?
4. One of the early studies was by Gerstein and Mandelbrot (1964). What
   is Mandelbrot better known for?
5. Why does the article say that I and F models are popular?
6. Why is it somewhat surprising that Lapique gave this description of
   the neuron in 1907? And does that explain why it was not more
   commonly utilized until the 1960s and later?
7. When plotting the Integrate and Fire neuron model how many axes do
   you need and what are the labels for them?

** The Integrate and Fire Equation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-integrate-and-fire-equation
   :END:
$$\tau \frac{dV(t)}{dt} = -V(t) + R~I(t)$$

1. What does $\frac{dV}{dt}$ mean?

   It is the derivative. It is the how the voltage changes as a function
   of how time changes.

2. What does $\frac{1}{\tau}$ mean?

   It is the membrane time constant and can be related to the membrane
   capacitance. Since it is a constant, with a clever choice of units
   you can assume it to be one and make it disappear.

3. Why does the voltage term on the right have a negative sign?

   To get the intuition of a model you don't always have to compute
   things. You can also get some qualitative behaviour just by looking
   at it. The larger the voltage the more negative becomes its rate of
   change and vice versa. It drives everything back to some point at
   which the rate of change to an equilibrium point. We will come back
   to this notion of a fixed point or attractor.

4. What is $I(t)$?

   It is the current term. $I$ is the common abbreviation for current.
   Why? I don't know, can someone help?

5. Put it all together

   The voltage in the future will be a sum of whatever current is being
   added minus a function of the current voltage.

6. Why, if we don't reach a threshold to fire an action potential, do we
   see an exponential decay?

   This is where you need to remember what came before. See that the
   change in voltage is proportional to itself. Solutions to these types
   of equations involve exponentials. Remember? But note the sign. It is
   negative. That is why it is an exponential decay instead of an
   exponential growth.

*** Where does the leaky integrate and fire equation come from?

    :END:

1. Group to write and explain Ohm's law again.

   *Ohm's Law* (empirically observed): $V = IR$

2. Group to explain what is the relationship between current and charge?

   Current: The derivative of charge with respect to time,
   $I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$

3. Group to explain *Kirchoff's Point Rule* again.

   Current sums to zero: All the current sources going to a node in a
   circuit must sum to zero.

4. Group to explain what is capacitance.

   Capacitance is a source of current. A capacitor is a sandwich of two
   conducting surfaces with a non-conducting body in between. If you a
   charge to one side, the electrons gather there. They can't leap the
   gap, so they exert an attraction for particles of the opposite charge
   on the other side of the gap. If you suddenly stop the charge then
   charge races around and you discharge a current.

5. Group to explain the relationship, mathematically, between
   capacitance, charge, and voltage.

   $C = Q/V.$ The volume of charge, per unit area, divided by the
   voltage that produces this imbalance in charge.

6. Together as a class, what happens when you differentiate this
   equation with respect to time and treat the capacitance as a
   constant?

   $C \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dQ}{dt} = I$

\begin{align/} I &= I_R + I_C \ I &= I_R + C\frac{dV}{dt}\ I &=

Get them to walk through the derivation with me, and understand how we
justify which steps we take.
